    "- **Could you specify on the baseline of accuracy in the spam email example?**\n",
    "- **how unbalanced data affects good accuracy values**\n",
    "    - the baseline accuracy is determined using the target variable of the training set\n",
    "    - the baseline accuracy is the fraction of points in the most populous class\n",
    "        - if 5% of emails are spam, and 95% of emails are not spam, 0.95 is the baseline accuracy because if you predict 'non-spam' for each point, you will be correct 95% of the times.\n",
    "    - the baseline is calculated differently for other evaluation metrics\n",
    "    - the general concept is to use the target variable only (no features) to figure out the baseline\n",
    "    - we will cover this later\n",
    "- **\"What is the alternative to the hard-coded cross validation loop? Is there a sci-kit learn function for running cross-validation and tuning hyperparameters at this stage?**\n",
    "    - yes there is and we will learn about it once you have solid foundations of the more basic techniques\n",
    "    - the issue is that these one-line scikit-learn solutions hide a lot of stuff from you so you should only use them if you know exactly what you are doing.\n",
    "- **Before this stage, during the train-test split, how important is training (10 models) using random_state_... is this just for small datasets?**\n",
    "    - the smaller you dataset, the more important it is\n",
    "    - generally speaking it is always a good idea to try at least 3 random states even if you dataset is large if you can manage it given your computational resources\n",
    "- **I do not have much experience in coding, and am not a 100% sure what each line of code in the examples do or represent - what are some resources I can look into to understand what is happening line by line?**\n",
    "- **I didn't understand the syntax and code of splitting**\n",
    "- **Maybe more clear explaination on the code**\n",
    "- **Would you be able to walk through the code for hyper tuning again? How did you come up with the parameters for np.logspace?**\n",
    "    - you should read the help of each function used in a line and print out all variables used in a line to know what's happening and how variables change\n",
    "- **If a new data point has a predicted probability of 0.2 does that mean it has an 80% probability that its target value will be 0?**\n",
    "    - depends. you will see that classification models return two columns when you predict probabilities: the class 0 probability and the class 1 probability\n",
    "    - the two probabilities sum to 1 for each point\n",
    "    - if the class 0 probability is 0.2, it means the point is class 1 with 80% probability\n",
    "    - if the class 1 probability is 0.2, it means the point is class 0 with 80% probability\n",
    "- **How does SVM work? Is it like linear regression, but the line is curvy**\n",
    "- **What exactly is C?**\n",
    "- **what is c mean for SVC**\n",
    "- **I am still unclear about what C is or what the hyperparameters are in the context of a ML algorithm.**\n",
    "    - it is a non-linear model and we will cover it in a few weeks\n",
    "- **I was a bit confused on the ML techniques portion. Will we eventually learn such techniques and when to apply them?**\n",
    "    - yes :)\n",
    "- **Could you please discuss bias-variance tradeoff again in the next class? Along with a few more real-time examples and how it can affect a data science project?**\n",
    "- **I am still a little confused about finding the ideal fit of the model based on the graph showing the c parameter and accuracy.**\n",
    "- **I thought the muddiest part of the lecture was the bias-variance tradeoff**\n",
    "- **Why is it necessary to have test and validation sets?**\n",
    "- **Could you explain in more detail what \"validation\" means and how its different from testing?**\n",
    "- **I was still a little unsure what the difference between validation and testing is?**\n",
    "- **I'm struggling with tuning the hyperparameters.**\n",
    "- **Parts 5-7 and c-values/cross validation in general just went over my head.**\n",
    "- **Still not quite clear on the rationale for validation vs. test set - what's the actual distinction?**\n",
    "    - I'll cover this again now\n",
    "- **What is the differencfe between X and Y and Curly XY?**\n",
    "    - curly X and curly Y are the sets of all possible instances and target variables\n",
    "    - regular X and Y are a (usually small) sample drawn from curly X and curly Y\n",
    "- **How do you know when you have done 'enough' EDA for a given dataset?**\n",
    "    - you don't know :) \n",
    "    - but at the very least you should know what each feature in your dataset means, you should know the typical summary statistics of each feature (we will discuss summary stats next tuesday)\n",
    "    - ML pipeline development is non-linear. we cover the steps in a linear fashion but sometimes you need to do more EDA after you do cross validation because something doesn't seem OK in your results for example\n",
    "- **And will we go over what characteristics we see in EDA that point to different ML methods?**\n",
    "    - such insights are very rare. generally you need to try as many models as you can. \n",
    "    - it is rare that you can exclude a ML model based on EDA\n",
    "- **How do we know the bounds and scale for hyperparameter tuning? For instance, the examples uses logscale.**\n",
    "    - we will cover this for each ML technique separately in a couple of weeks\n",
    "- **Once we get an optimal hyper parameter for one random state split of our data, do we then use that C retroactively for each random state we test after that?**\n",
    "    - no, you would determine an optimal C for each random state\n",
    "    - you might find that different Cs are optimal for different random states\n",
    "- **What other evaluation metrics are common and how do we determine which is appropriate?**\n",
    "    - we will spend a week on this question :)\n",
    "- **It would have been better if there were an example table of the learner's input , especially the label set Y.**\n",
    "- **Needs to know the basic concept of data set**\n",

    "## The steps\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: you need to understand your data and verify that it doesn't contain errors</span>\n",
    "   - do as much EDA as you can!\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Split the data into different sets**: most often the sets are train, validation, and test (or holdout)\n",
    "   - practitioners often make errors in this step!\n",
    "   - you can split the data randomly, based on groups, based on time, or any other non-standard way if necessary to answer your ML question\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Preprocess the data**: ML models only work if X and Y are numbers! Some ML models additionally require each feature to have 0 mean and 1 standard deviation (standardized features)\n",
    "   - often the original features you get contain strings (for example a gender feature would contain 'male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'unknown') which needs to transformed into numbers\n",
    "   - often the features are not standardized (e.g., age is between 0 and 100) but it needs to be standardized\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. Choose an evaluation metric**: depends on the priorities of the stakeholders\n",
    "   - often requires quite a bit of thinking and ethical considerations\n",
    "     \n",
    "**5. Choose one or more ML techniques**: it is highly recommended that you try multiple models\n",
    "   - start with simple models like linear or logistic regression\n",
    "   - try also more complex models like nearest neighbors, support vector machines, random forest, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**6. Tune the hyperparameters of your ML models (aka cross-validation)**\n",
    "   - ML techniques have hyperparameters that you need to optimize to achieve best performance\n",
    "   - for each ML model, decide which parameters to tune and what values to try\n",
    "   - loop through each parameter combination\n",
    "       - train one model for each parameter combination\n",
    "       - evaluate how well the model performs on the validation set\n",
    "   - take the parameter combo that gives the best validation score\n",
    "   - evaluate that model on the test set to report how well the model is expected to perform on previously unseen data\n",
    "    \n",
    "**7. Interpret your model**: black boxes are often not useful\n",
    "   - check if your model uses features that make sense (excellent tool for debugging)\n",
    "   - often model predictions are not enough, you need to be able to explain how the model arrived to a particular prediction (e.g., in health care)"
